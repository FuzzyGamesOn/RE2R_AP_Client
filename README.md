# RE2R AP Client
Archipelago randomizer client for Resident Evil 2 Remake, designed to work with the RE2R apworld here: https://github.com/FuzzyGamesOn/RE2R_AP_World/releases

## IMPORTANT / READ FIRST

**READ THE INSTALL STEPS BELOW. YOU WILL LIKELY END UP WITH SOMETHING BROKEN IF YOU DON'T.**

Also, important tips:
- Don't use typewriter teleports to skip either the Helicopter or the Mr. X arrival scenes, or to leave/skip any of the G fights. **YOU WILL HARDLOCK.**
- Don't enter any non-Ada cutscenes while Ada is following you. **YOU WILL HARDLOCK.**
- Do not switch save files when playing the same seed, or you may lose items.
- Save often. Save after boss fights.
