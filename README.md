# RE2R AP Client
Archipelago randomizer client for Resident Evil 2 Remake, designed to work with the RE2R apworld here: https://github.com/FuzzyGamesOn/RE2R_AP_World/releases

## IMPORTANT / READ FIRST

- Wait until you enter RPD to connect to Archipelago. This ensures that an item box is loaded.
- Don't use typewriter teleports to skip either the Helicopter or the Mr. X arrival scenes, or to leave/skip any of the G fights. **YOU WILL HARDLOCK.**
- Don't enter any non-Ada cutscenes while Ada is following you. **YOU WILL HARDLOCK.**
- Don't use the T-Bar Handle to open Secret Room before reaching Sewers normally (i.e., passing Annette's initial cutscene) as the main character. **YOU WILL LIKELY HARDLOCK.**
- Don't attach Wristband chips to the Wristband you receive from Ada until after you've entered the front door of Labs. **YOU WILL HARDLOCK.**
- Don't fight G2 in Sewers until you're ready to leave Sewers for Labs. **YOU MIGHT HARDLOCK IN WATERWAYS.**
- Do not switch save files, or you may lose items.
- Save often. Save after boss fights.

## Install Steps

1. Download REFramework from the most recent release here: https://github.com/praydog/REFramework/releases
    - If you're using the normal game, get the RE2 zip. If you're using the non Ray Tracing beta on Steam, get the RE2_TDB66 zip.
2. Extract the REFramework zip in your RE2 game folder (Steam or otherwise)
    - Once you've done this, you should have an reframework folder in your game folder, and it should've added a dinput8.dll to the game folder.
3. Download the source for this client via the Releases page, extract that zip somewhere, and copy both the "reframework" folder and the lua-apclientpp.dll file into your game folder.
    - It may ask to overwrite or merge on the "reframework" folder, just click Yes.
5. That's it! Start the game and enjoy!
