# RE2R AP Client
Archipelago randomizer client for Resident Evil 2 Remake, designed to work with the RE2R apworld here: https://github.com/FuzzyGamesOn/RE2R_AP_World/releases

## IMPORTANT / READ FIRST

- Wait until you enter RPD to connect to Archipelago. This ensures that an item box is loaded.
- Don't use typewriter teleports to skip either the Helicopter or the Mr. X arrival scenes, or to leave/skip any of the G fights. **YOU WILL HARDLOCK.**
- Don't enter any non-Ada cutscenes while Ada is following you. **YOU WILL HARDLOCK.**
- Do not switch save files, or you may lose items

## Install Steps

1. Download REFramework from the most recent release here: https://github.com/praydog/REFramework/releases
    a. If you're using the normal game, get the RE2 zip. If you're using the non Ray Tracing beta on Steam, get the RE2_TDB66 zip.
2. Extract the REFramework zip in your RE2 game folder (Steam or otherwise)
    a. Once you've done this, you should have an reframework folder in your game folder, and it should've added a dinput8.dll to the game folder.
3. Download the source for this client via the Releases page, extract that zip somewhere, and copy just the "reframework" folder into your game folder.
    a. It may ask to overwrite or merge, just click Yes.
4. Download the AP REF Client from the most recent release here: https://github.com/FuzzyGamesOn/Archipelago_REF_Client/releases
    a. You just need the .dll file. Place that .dll in the reframework/plugins folder in your game folder.
5. That's it! Start the game and enjoy!
